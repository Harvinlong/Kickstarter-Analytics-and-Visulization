# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Visualizing data with Excel
### Purpose
The perpose is to find out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
Control different campaigns to find out the relationship
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Summer time is the best period to launch a project
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Most of the small, median project make profit in a shorter payback period
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Group value to make a better visualization
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 1： The overall trend from January to June was upward, with a small blip in March but a quick correction
 2：The overall decline was gradual from July to the end of the year, with a correction in October but a quick return to the downward trend

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The range between 1,000 and 4,999 has the highest number of projects and the highest probability of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The income and expenditure are not detailed in the chart, so it is difficult to judge the actual effective revenue efficiency of each project

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
This data table allows you to fan chart the ratio of each different type of broadcast platform, such as movie platform, short video platform
