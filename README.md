# Kickstarter Data Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the Kickstarter dataset to help the stakeholders understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. The project includes creating two technical analysis deliverables, an outcomes chart based on launch dates, and an outcomes chart based on funding goals. The goal is to provide insights and actionable recommendations to help the stakeholders make informed decisions for future crowdfunding campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
Control different campaigns to find out the relationship
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Summer time is the best period to launch a project
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Most of the small, median project make profit in a shorter payback period
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Group value to make a better visualization
## Results
